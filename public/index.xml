      <description>&lt;p&gt;The blockchain ecosystem began with a singular, isolated network—Bitcoin. As more chains emerged, the need for interoperability—the ability for different blockchains to communicate and exchange value—became evident. This post takes you through the pivotal moments in the history of crypto interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post is going to be technical diving deeper in each solution that emerged during this time and also will give you a glimpse of how future technologies look like. It&amp;rsquo;s not just a fact/research post, its the history with filled with my own experiences and opinions about interop and crypto overall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
